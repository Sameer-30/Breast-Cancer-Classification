# Breast Cancer Tumor Classification

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors based on fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset captures cell nucleus characteristics, with tumors labeled as either **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**.

## Dataset Overview:
- **ID Number**: Unique identifier for each sample.
- **Diagnosis**: Label indicating whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Workflow Overview:
1. **Dataset Collection**: Acquiring FNA dataset with cell nucleus features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Dividing the data into training and testing subsets.
4. **Model Training**: Building a logistic regression model to classify tumors.
5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict whether a new sample is benign or malignant.
